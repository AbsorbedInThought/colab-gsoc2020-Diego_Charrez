# Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving with Gazebo and OpenAI gym

## Abstract

JdeRobot provides a set of tools for developing robotic applications, including previous work in autonomous driving robots that use techniques like a classification neural networks or regression neural networks, Therefore one of the main goals of these project is to combine OpenAI Gym and Gazebo to use Reinforcement Learning algorithms for autonomous driving, Moreover, it would led us benchmark previous techniques with RL. I plan to do the following over the summer combine OpenAI Gym and Gazebo.

- Implement Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
- Benchmark previous approaches with Deep Reinforcement Learning.
- Document and propose exercises.


## Timeline 
### May 4 - 31:  Community Bonding Period
- Blog Set up and configuration for GSoC.
- Try it out the gym-gazebo examples.
- Experimented with the Behavior Studio.
- Multiple meetings with mentors.
### June 1 - June 29: Coding Part 1
#### Week  (June 1 - 5)
-
