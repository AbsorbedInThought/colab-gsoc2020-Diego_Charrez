# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving with Gazebo and OpenAI Gym

## Abstract

JdeRobot provides a set of tools for developing robotic applications, including previous work in autonomous driving robots that use algorithms like a classification neural networks or regression neural networks, Therefore one of the main goals of this project is to combine OpenAI Gym and Gazebo to use Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for autonomous driving. Moreover, it would let us benchmark previous algorithms with DRL.
