Behavior Studio is a set of tools written in python that uses the JdeRobot toolkit for comparing different autonomous driving networks [\[1\]](https://github.com/JdeRobot/BehaviorStudio/tree/reboot).

## Jderobot Base

The Jderobot Base repository maintains the open source code implementation of the Jderobot toolkit that contains many tools and libraries to bring hardware abstraction, develop computer vision and many more. [\[2\]](https://github.com/JdeRobot/base).

## Jderobot Assets

This Jderobot Assets provides all the necessary worlds and models needed by the examples and exercises from Jderobot toolkit [\[3\]](https://github.com/JdeRobot/assets).
