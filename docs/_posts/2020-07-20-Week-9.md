# Week 9

This is the evaluation week of second month at Google Summer of Code, it is a little bit sad that there is just one month left of the program, I have been learning a lot and enjoying working at Jderobot.

The main tasks for this week are around behavior studio GUI and gym gazebo for q-learning with the formula 1 models. First I am going to update the models at the CustomRobots repository where models should use official gazebo plugins, instead of the previous custom ones from Jderobot base.

Once all models are uploaded to CustomRobots, those would be used by Behavior Studio within docker images and native installation. Gym Gazebo has been updated for ros-noetic but it is still working independently, it should be changed so it can work using the controls from Behavior Studio.

And finally some testing needs to be done once gym gazebo works along with behavior studio, first the q-learning with formula 1 laser should generate a model that can drive the formula 1 through the behavior studio GUI.
