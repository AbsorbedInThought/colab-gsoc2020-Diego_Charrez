# Week 4

Almost a month has passed since the coding period started!. This week I mainly worked on forks of the official Jderobot's repositories, and addressed some issues.

The challenge for this week was to upgrade Behavior Studio to python3 with ROS Noetic and Focal Fossa.

This week I did iterate a lot within the containers and manage to get most of the functionalities working at Behavior Studio's GUI.

## Week's 3 issues

Solved the issues mentioned in the week3's post related to PyQt5 in ubuntu 20.04 and Missing assets for ROS Noetic. I was not sure why some images were not loaded in the GUI, but turns out that after generating the binaries in `resources.py` from `resources.qrc` needs to be imported before using the assets. Although it was imported, it was using the relative path so using the absolute path fixed the problem.

I learned more about PyQt5 going through the code to figure out what was missing!.

The other problem I had last week about ROS nodes, was solved by building the latest jderobot-assets for Noetic, once the assets were sourced Behavior Studio stopped complaining about the master node.
