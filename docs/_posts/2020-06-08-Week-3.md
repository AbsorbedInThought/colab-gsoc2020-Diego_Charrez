# Week 3

As it was mentioned in the previous post, it is necessary to migrate the current Behavior Studio from python2 to python3, since python2 has been deprecated many months ago.

Besides that, python2 has presented some conflict with the Behavior Studio's GUI which uses PyQt5, it is somewhat difficult to make them work together.

So for this week I have been writing Dockerfiles in separate branch, to build Behavior Studio faster.

## Melodic with python 2

## Melodic with python 3

## Noetic

## Docker - GUI

There are many ways to expose a GUI outside a docker container [\[1\]](http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/GUI), but the one I have chosen for is VNC because it is easy to setup and it does not consume a lot of resources.


# Week Highlights

- During the development process I have been hosting the container in my docker hub account 
    - [Jderobot-base](https://hub.docker.com/r/uddua/jderobot-base)
    - [Jderobot-behavior-studio](https://hub.docker.com/r/uddua/jderobot-behavior-studio)
- Here is the list of the branches that I have been working
    - [Behavior Studio - python_3.6.9](https://github.com/dcharrezt/BehaviorStudio/tree/python_3.6.9)
    - [Behavior Studio - docker](https://github.com/dcharrezt/BehaviorStudio/tree/docker)
