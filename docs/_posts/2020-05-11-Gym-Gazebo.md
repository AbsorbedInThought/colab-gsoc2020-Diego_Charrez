# Definitions

### OpenAI Gym

OpenAI Gym is a framework to test and developed reinforcement learning algorithms, it includes many environments like the Atari games.

### Gazebo

Is an open-source 3D robotics simulator.

### Behaviour Studio

Is a tool that will benchmark different algorithms for autonomous driving using Jderobot tools.

# Using Behaviour Studio, Gym and Gazebo

I used the [installation guide](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-ignacio-arranz/tree/master/gym-gazebo) from Ignacio Arranz's master thesis [repository](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-ignacio-arranz) 

### Installation

#### ROS Melodic and Gazebo 9.0 in Ubuntu 18.04
[ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu)
```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

I got some this error, because my tf2_ros was working with python2

```bash
ImportError: dynamic module does not define module export function (PyInit__tf2)
```

I tried many possible solutions like these.

[Attempted solution](https://answers.ros.org/question/326226/importerror-dynamic-module-does-not-define-module-export-function-pyinit__tf2/)

Then reading many other forums and questions, I spent many hours trying to fix, but I couldnt make it work even with the turtle example. So I decided to make a clean build following this [blog](https://www.miguelalonsojr.com/blog/robotics/ros/python3/2019/08/20/ros-melodic-python-3-build.html)
