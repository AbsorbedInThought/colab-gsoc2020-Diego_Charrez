I am glad that I would be learning and working with the awesome community of Jderobot. I share their passion for developing robotics applications.


## firsts steps

For my first [issue](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2020-Diego_Charrez/issues/1), I have to set up a blog where I can write my progress. This [repository](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2020-Diego_Charrez) is going to have code and documentation for my project.

I am setting up this blog [template](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-ignacio-arranz) which I like and I am happy to use it for the project. Moreover, it is well organized and easy to personalize.
