So far I have gotten a warm welcome from this awesome community, I share the passion for robotics and artificial intelligence and I am pretty sure that I am going to enjoy working on this summer project!.


## firsts steps

For my fist [issue](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2020-Diego_Charrez/issues/1), in the [repository](https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2020-Diego_Charrez) that I will be using for the project.

I am setting up this jekyll website [template](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-ignacio-arranz) which I really like and I am happy to use it for the project. Moreover, it is well organized and easy to personalize.
