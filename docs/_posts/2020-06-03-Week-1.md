I spent the community bonding period learning more about Jderobot's behavior studio which focuses on using deep learning for self driving cars. It was also great to talk to my mentors, they are very kind and supportive, and know more about the Jderobot community.

This first week of the coding period, I started by studying the tensorflow agents library which has a set of great tutorials, and implemented some basic examples with Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Additionally I set up a Dockerfile to ease my work.

This exploration work with tensorflow agents and DQN in easier environments, would help to translate the implementation to the Formula 1 environment.
