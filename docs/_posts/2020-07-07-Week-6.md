# Week 6

Since Behavior Studio is stable for noetic, and guides for its installation has been updated now we can focus on having the plugins for formula 1 working for noetic and adding support for Reinforcement learning within Behavior Studio.

{% endcapture %}

For the first task the Jderobot organization has created a new repository that is going to host these new plugins and many more new things to come, the aim is make each other project more independent.

## Gym Gazebo

This library previously developed for ubuntu 18 by Erlrobot [\[1\]](https://github.com/erlerobot/gym-gazebo) works well for melodic and ubuntu bionic but the project was archived so there is not version for ubuntu focal, so I have been trying to adequate it for noetic, taking previous changes made from other collaborator from Behavior Studio [\[2\]](https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-ignacio-arranz).

At the moment of writing this blog I could not make it work, seem like there are multiple incompatibilities between libraries as it was expected due to the changes noetic and ubuntu focal.

Here are shown some errors from the `catkin_ws/build/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log`.

```bash
/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lpthreads
fatal error: pgm.h: No such file or directory
```

## Week's 5 issues

Since the most stable version for python is somewhere between 3.6 and 3.7, it would be better to work with virtual environments in order to support most deep learning frameworks. Therefore, the installation has been updated accordingly.
