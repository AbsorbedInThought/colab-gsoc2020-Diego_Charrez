# Week 6

Since Behavior Studio is stable for noetic, and guides for its installation has been updated now we can focus on having the plugins for formula 1 working for noetic and adding support for Reinforcement learning within Behavior Studio.

For the first task the Jderobot organization has created a new repository that is going to host these new plugins and many more new things to come, the aim is make each other project more independent.


## Week's 5 issues

Since the most stable version for python is somewhere between 3.6 and 3.7, it would be better to work with virtual environments in order to support most deep learning frameworks. Therefore, the installation has been updated accordingly.
