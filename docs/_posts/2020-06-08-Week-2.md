## Running Behavior Studio with Python 3

https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/installation/

### Installation

First I created an environment to easily take control of the packages installed.

```bash
virtualenv -p python3 .bh_python3
source .bh_python3/bin/activate
```

Then I added some libraries which were missing and increased the version required for numpy and PyQt5 in the `requirements.txt`.

```bash
numpy==1.16.0
PyQt5==5.15.0
rospkg
pathlib
PyQt3D
```

All necessary libraries can be installed to our virtual environment by running:

```bash
python install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the Behavior Studio's GUI, first we need to create a configuration file in next to the `driver.py` file, I created mine under the name of `default.yml`.

```yml
Behaviors:
    Robot:
        Sensors:
            Cameras:
                Camera_0:
                    Name: 'camera_0'
                    Topic: '/F1ROS/cameraL/image_raw'
            Pose3D:
                Pose3D_0:
                    Name: 'pose3d_0'
                    Topic: '/F1ROS/odom'
        Actuators:
            Motors:
                Motors_0:
                    Name: 'motors_0'
                    Topic: '/F1ROS/cmd_vel'
                    MaxV: 3
                    MaxW: 0.3
        BrainPath: 'brains/f1/brain_f1_opencv.py'
        Type: 'f1'
    Simulation:
        World: /opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/launch/f1_1_simplecircuit.launch
    Dataset:
        In: '/tmp/my_bag.bag'
        Out: ''
    Layout:
        Frame_0:
            Name: frame_0
            Geometry: [1, 1, 2, 2]
            Data: rgbimage
        Frame_1:
            Name: frame_1
            Geometry: [0, 1, 1, 1]
            Data: rgbimage
        Frame_2:
            Name: frame_2
            Geometry: [0, 2, 1, 1]
            Data: rgbimage
        Frame_3:
            Name: frame_3
            Geometry: [0, 3, 3, 1]
            Data: rgbimage
```            

By running the GUI I get this error, which I address in the next section.

```bash
python driver.py -c default.yml -g

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "driver.py", line 22, in <module>
    from pilot import Pilot
  File "/home/eisen/pull_requests/forked_behavior_studio/behavior_suite/pilot.py", line 22, in <module>
    from utils.logger import logger
  File "/home/eisen/pull_requests/forked_behavior_studio/behavior_suite/utils/logger.py", line 5, in <module>
    from colors import Colors
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'colors''
```

### Porting to Python3

#### imports

The first error we got is because in Python 3 uses absolute imports [\[1\]](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/). The following call:

```python
from colors import Color
```

Should be

```python
from utils.colors import Color
```

Because the absolute path where `driver.py` is ran starts in `behavior_suite` directory.

```bash
├── behavior_suite
│
└── utils
    ├── colors.py
    ├── configuration.py
    ├── constants.py
    ├── controller.py
    ├── environment.py
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── logger.py
```
#### Missing log directory. 

```bash
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/behavior_studio/behavior_suite/logs/log.log'
```

For now I just created it manually.

```bash
mkdir logs
touch logs/log.log
```

#### Subprocess

the function checkout_out does not return an string directly thats why we are having this error.

```bash
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "driver.py", line 190, in <module>
    main()
  File "driver.py", line 158, in main
    environment.launch_env(app_configuration.current_world)
  File "/home/eisen/pull_requests/forked_behavior_studio/behavior_suite/utils/environment.py", line 39, in launch_env
    close_gazebo()
  File "/home/eisen/pull_requests/forked_behavior_studio/behavior_suite/utils/environment.py", line 56, in close_gazebo
    ps_output = subprocess.check_output(["ps", "-Af"]).strip("\n")
TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'
```

It can be fixed by decoding the output before doing the strip.

```python
ps_output = subprocess.check_output(["ps", "-Af"]).strip("\n")
ps_output = subprocess.check_output(["ps", "-Af"]).decode('utf-8').strip("\n")
```

#### Unused package

I could not find the implementation of resource, and It was not being used in the script so I just commented it.

```bash
cannot import name 'resources'
```

```python
#from ui.gui.resources import resources
```

#### OpenCV2

```bash
  File "/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/rospy/topics.py", line 750, in _invoke_callback
    cb(msg)
  File "/home/eisen/pull_requests/forked_behavior_studio/behavior_suite/robot/interfaces/camera.py", line 63, in __callback
    image = imageMsg2Image(img, self.bridge)
  File "/home/eisen/pull_requests/forked_behavior_studio/behavior_suite/robot/interfaces/camera.py", line 26, in imageMsg2Image
    cv_image = bridge.imgmsg_to_cv2(img, "rgb8")
  File "/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cv_bridge/core.py", line 163, in imgmsg_to_cv2
    dtype, n_channels = self.encoding_to_dtype_with_channels(img_msg.encoding)
  File "/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cv_bridge/core.py", line 99, in encoding_to_dtype_with_channels
    return self.cvtype2_to_dtype_with_channels(self.encoding_to_cvtype2(encoding))
  File "/opt/ros/melodic/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cv_bridge/core.py", line 91, in encoding_to_cvtype2
    from cv_bridge.boost.cv_bridge_boost import getCvType
```    

OpenCV was build for melodic with python 2.7, thankfully is possible to extend the environment with a built with python 3


```bash
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools python3-dev python3-catkin-pkg-modules python3-numpy python3-yaml ros-melodic-cv-bridge
mkdir catkin_workspace
cd catkin_workspace
catkin init
# Is possible to change the python version
catkin config -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.6m -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.6m.so
catkin config --install
git clone https://github.com/ros-perception/vision_opencv.git src/vision_opencv
apt-cache show ros-melodic-cv-bridge | grep Version
    Version: 1.13.0-0bionic.20200320.133849 # change to your version accordingly
cd src/vision_opencv/ 
git checkout 1.13.0
cd ../../
catkin build cv_bridge
source install/setup.bash --extend # or use setup.zsh
```
