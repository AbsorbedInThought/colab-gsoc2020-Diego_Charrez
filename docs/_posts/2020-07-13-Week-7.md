# Week 7

Last week I started upgrading the gym gazebo library that only has support for ubuntu 18.04 with melodic. As a result, to be compatible with behavior studio that works with ubuntu 20.04 and noetic, it is a key piece for the project to have it working in ubuntu 20.04.

# Gym Gazebo for ubuntu 20

At first I tried to update each dependency to noetic, but that would needed a lot of refactoring, some dependencies broke because in ubuntu 20 there was new versions for others tools so I could not make them compile.

Ubuntu 20 supports PCL 1.10 (Point cloud library) as default, but gym-gazebo has the package ar_track_alvar (ROS wrapper for Alvar) as a dependency which only seems to work with PCL 1.8.1. [\[3\]](http://wiki.ros.org/ar_track_alvar)

I ended reviewing which dependencies are necessary for the project and got rid off the ones that are not being used for the formula 1 model.

After I manage to compile the library, I started updating some old python2 syntax, and merged gym-gazebo's requirements with the requirements at Behavior Studio.

I tested that everything was working with CPU and GPU, so the following steps was to update docker images with this update and document the installation properly.
