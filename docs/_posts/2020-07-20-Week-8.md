# Week 8

Last week gym gazebo was upgraded to support ROS noetic, and worked on decoupling the formula plugins from Jderobot's dependencies. Therefore, all plugins for formula 1 must be working and gym gazebo must be integrated to behavior studio.

Also it is time to try out q-learning with the formula 1 using a lidar as perception, once this is done it would be possible to test other more complex agents like the one with camera.

# Week Highlights

- Issues

- Pull Requests

- From now on I will be working directly on the main repositories as suggested by my mentor, so all changes would be visible for other members of the team.
