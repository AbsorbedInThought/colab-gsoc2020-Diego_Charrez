# Week 10

For this week the gym gazebo training should be done directly from Behavior Studio GUI, this task involves that a proper brain class is created inside the folder structure so when the user defines its *yml* file with `f1rl` it directly searches all reinforcement learning brain for formula1.

# Issues

Recently the gpu nvidia driver were updated to CUDA11 this has broken the training in gpu in my computer, which was previously using CUDA10.1 and tested in that version. I am looking for a solution for running Behavior Studio with newer drivers.
