<p>JdeRobot provides a set of tools for developing robotic applications, including previous work in autonomous driving robots that use techniques like a classification neural networks or regression neural networks, Therefore one of the main goals of these project is to combine OpenAI Gym and Gazebo to use Reinforcement Learning algorithms for autonomous driving, Moreover, it would led us benchmark previous techniques with RL. I plan to do the following over the summer combine OpenAI Gym and Gazebo.</p>

<p>Implement Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms.
Benchmark previous approaches with Deep Reinforcement Learning.
Document and propose exercises.</p>
