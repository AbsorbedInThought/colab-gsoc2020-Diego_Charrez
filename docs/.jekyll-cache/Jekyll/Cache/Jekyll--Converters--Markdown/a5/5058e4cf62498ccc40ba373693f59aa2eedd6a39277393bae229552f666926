<p>For my first <a href="https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2020-Diego_Charrez/issues/1">issue</a>, I have to set up a blog where I can write my progress. This <a href="https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2020-Diego_Charrez">repository</a> is going to have code and documentation for my project.</p>

<p>I am setting up this blog <a href="https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-ignacio-arranz">template</a> which I like and I am happy to use it for the project. Moreover, it is well organized and easy to personalize.</p>
