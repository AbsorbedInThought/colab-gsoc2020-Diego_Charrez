I"\<p>So far I have gotten a warm welcome from this awesome community, I share the passion for robotics and artificial intelligence and I am pretty sure that I am going to enjoy working on this summer project!.</p>

<h2 id="firsts-steps">firsts steps</h2>

<p>For my fist <a href="https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2020-Diego_Charrez/issues/1">issue</a>, I have to set up a blog where I can write my progress. This <a href="https://github.com/TheRoboticsClub/colab-gsoc2020-Diego_Charrez">repository</a> is going to have code and documentation for my project.</p>

<p>I am setting up this jekyll blog <a href="https://github.com/RoboticsLabURJC/2019-tfm-ignacio-arranz">template</a> which I really like and I am happy to use it for the project. Moreover, it is well organized and easy to personalize.</p>
